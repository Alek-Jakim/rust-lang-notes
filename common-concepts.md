## Common Concepts in Rust


## **1. Guessing Game**

```rust
use std::io;
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess");



    //To summarize, the let mut guess = String::new(); line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a String. Whew!
    let mut guess = String::new();

    let secret_num = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..10);

    //If we hadn‚Äôt put the use std::io line at the beginning of the program, we could have written this function call as std::io::stdin. The stdin function returns an instance of std::io::Stdin, which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    println!("You guessed {}", guess);

    
    match guess.cmp(&secret_num) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small! The secret number was {}", secret_num),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big! The secret number was {}", secret_num),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win! The secret number was {}", secret_num),
    }
}
```

## **2. Variables and Mutability**

* By default variables are immutable.

* When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can‚Äôt change that value.

* You can make variables mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name.

* In cases where you‚Äôre using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to think through.


### **Differences Between Variables and Constants**

* First, you aren‚Äôt allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren‚Äôt just immutable by default‚Äîthey‚Äôre always immutable.

* You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value **must** be annotated. 

* Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope - useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

* The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

```rust
// Rust‚Äôs naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.

const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

* Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in - useful for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know about (maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or the speed of light).


### **Shadowing**

Shadowing --> you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable.

Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable‚Äôs value is what the program sees when the variable is used.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
        // x is 12
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    // x is 6
}
```

* Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we‚Äôll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword.

The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we‚Äôre effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name:

```rust
//Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name. 

let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

## **3. Data Types**

* Two data type subsets: **scalar** and **compound**.

* Rust is a *statically typed* language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time

* In cases when many types are possible, such as when converting a `String` to a numeric type using `parse`, we must add a type annotation.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");

let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
// Error: ^^^^^ consider giving `guess` a type
```

### **Scalar Types**

* A scalar type represents a single value.

* Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.


#### **Integer Types**

| Length        | Signed           | Unsigned  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 8-bit      | i8 | u8 |
| 16-bit     | i16      |   u16 |
| 32-bit     | i32     |    $32 |
| 64-bit      | i64 | u64 |
| 128-bit     | i128      |   u128 |
| arch     | isize     |    usize |

* Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. 

* *Signed* and *unsigned* refer to whether it‚Äôs possible for the number to be negative‚Äîin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). 

* Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n</sup> - 1) to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 - 1 inclusive, where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses.

* Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.

* You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the table below:

| Number literals        | Example           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Decimal      | `98_222` | 
| Hex     | `0xff`      |   
| Octal     | `0o77`     |    
| Binary      | `0b1111_0000` |  
| Byte    | `b'A'`      |    

* How do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to `i32`.

* The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

* *Integer Overflow* - Let‚Äôs say you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside of that range, such as 256, *integer overflow* will occur.

* When you‚Äôre compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Rust performs *two‚Äôs complement wrapping*. Relying on integer overflow‚Äôs wrapping behavior is considered an error.

#### **Floating-Point Types**

* Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively.

* The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

* Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

#### **Numeric Operations**

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

#### **Numeric Operations**

* Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

#### **The Character Type**

* Rust‚Äôs `char` type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type. (`char` literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.)

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = '‚Ñ§';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```

* Rust‚Äôs `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 

* Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust.

* Your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a `char` is in Rust. 

### **Compound Types**

* Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### **The Tuple Type**

* A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.

* The variable `tup` binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered a single compound element. 

```rust
fn main() {
    // The types of the different values in the tuple don‚Äôt have to be the same.
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value
    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    // We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value
    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;
}
```

* The tuple without any values, `()`, is a special type that has only one value, also written `()`. The type is called the *unit type* and the value is called the *unit value*. Expressions implicitly return the *unit value* if they don‚Äôt return any other value.


#### **The Array Type**

* Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 

* Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

* Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap, or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.

* A **vector** is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that *is* allowed to grow or shrink in size.

* If you‚Äôre unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector.

```rust
// Here it is better to use an array since you know you will not add or remove months (probably)

let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```

```rust
// Here, i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.

let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];


let b = [3; 5];
println!("{:?}", b);
// Prints [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

#### Accessing Array Elements

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

## **4. Functions**

* Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.

* Rust doesn‚Äôt care where you define your functions, only that they‚Äôre defined somewhere.

```rust
    //X is the parameter.
    fn another_function(x: i32) {
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }

    //The concrete value 5 is the argument
    another_function(5);
```

* In function signatures, you *must* declare the type of each parameter.

```rust
fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {}{}", value, unit_label);
}
```


#### **Function Bodies Contain Statements and Expressions**

* Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

* Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. 

* *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.

* *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value.

```rust
//This will throw an error
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}

// The let y = 6 statement does not return a value, so there isn‚Äôt anything for x to bind to.

// In C and Ruby, the assignment returns the value of the assignment.

// In those languages, you can write x = y = 6 and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.
```

* Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that you‚Äôll write in Rust.

* Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, `{}`, is an expression.


#### **Functions with Return Values**

* Functions can return values to the code that calls them.

* We don‚Äôt name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`).

* In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function.

* You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly.

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
